# Spring Boot MongoDB Redis with Authentication and Authorization

Spring Boot (3.0.1), Java (17.0.4.1), lombok, modelMapper, mongoDB and Redis are used in this sample.

Some deprecated methods come with Spring Boot new version are also fixed.

You should update application properties file content with your own information.

The project supports 3 types of Authentication as ADMIN, FIRM and USER roles and some test APIs are implemented. 

You could configure APIs with these roles when creating them.

I am going to add also ELK with this source.
